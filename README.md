Our homepage was built utilizing bootstrap giving users the ability to navigate to the sign up page to create an account or the login page. There are three more cards giving the user the ability to learn more about our site.

#### The Sign Up Page
***
![screenshote of sign up page]()

Our sign up page allows the user to create an account to start adding vehicles to their inventory database. This page uses the POST route to add the user info into a user Postgres database.

#### The Login Page
***

The Login page takes the user inputed email and passsword and compares it to the hashed email and password that is located in the database if it is a match the user gains access to the inventory database if it doesnt match they will be alerted with incorrect info.
